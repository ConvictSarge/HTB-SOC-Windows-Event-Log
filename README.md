HTB - Windows Event Logs and Analyzing Evil

I have decided to start journaling my learning path. This starts it with Hack The Box Academy's SOC Analyst Path. I have completed a couple modules in the path already and will not be going backwards to document those, so it will start from here. 

As I have previous experiences with the Windows Event Viewer, this module shouldn't be too hard. As it is short.
